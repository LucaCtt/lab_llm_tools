"""
Task 4: RAG Agent with Tool Calling
======================================
Goal: wrap the three retrieval strategies from Task 3 as LLM tools and let the
model decide which one (or which combination) to use for each question.

The model will:
  1. Receive a question.
  2. Choose a retrieval tool (or multiple).
  3. Use the tool output as context.
  4. Produce a grounded final answer.

You can refere to example_2_function_calls.py for a template on how to implement tool calling with litellm.

Instructions
---
1. Complete run_agent() following the pattern in example_2_function_calls.py.
2. Test with at least three questions and observe which tool(s) the model picks.
